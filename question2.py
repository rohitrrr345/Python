# Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. Hereâ€™s a code snippet to demonstrate
import threading
from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Define a custom signal
my_signal = Signal()

# Receiver function for the signal
@receiver(my_signal)
def signal_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Signal thread ID:", threading.get_ident())

# Django view that triggers the signal
def my_view(request):
    print("Caller thread ID:", threading.get_ident())
    my_signal.send(sender=None)
    return HttpResponse("Signal test complete")
# When you access my_view, the console output would show:

# Caller thread ID: 12345
# Signal thread ID: 12345
# The matching thread IDs confirm that Django signals, by default, run in the same thread as the caller.
